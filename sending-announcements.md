# Sending the Media Team Announcements or Videos

Each week we try to review the app to see if there are any upcoming events or announcements that need slides, but this is never guaranteed.

Announcements, videos, and all "special" things are due no later than Wednesday at 5pm before the worship service.  Anything sent after that time may not make it into the presentation.  (If your announcement is high priority and urgent, also text Cameron after following these instructions to make sure you message is not missed.)

Following these instructions will get your announcement into the next Sunday morning worship presentation.

## Prepared Image Slide

If you have an image slide which you have prepared in advance, thank you!  This is our favorite way to add announcements.

We prefer PNG images with a size of 1920x1080 (16:9).  We also accept JPEG images, but _not_ PDF, TIFF, BMP, or HEIC (common on iPhones).

[Canva](https://www.canva.com) is our favorite web-based tool for creating announcement slides.  If you will be making slides frequently, talk to Cameron about getting onto the church's Canva for Non-Profits account.

## Powerpoint Slides

If possible, please use PowerPoint's export feature to save your slide as a PNG image, and send us that.  This will ensure that your chosen fonts and images will look exactly the way you want them to.  If you are unsure how to do this, please text Cameron and he can walk you through it!

If you are sending an entire PowerPoint deck (perhaps as a guest speaker?), send it to media@wwcoc.org _and_ text Cameron to make sure it was recieved correctly and looks the way you intended.

## Keynote (or anything else)

We absolutely cannot accept Keynote files or any other slideshow format.  Please export your presentation to one of the above formats.

## Videos

We can play 1080p and 720p mp4 video files up to 600MB in size, but PLEASE do not try to email us large video files.  Links to publicly accessible YouTube or Vimeo video are typically fine.

Videos often require some discussion.  If this is your first time sending us a video, please text Cameron to discuss your video at least a week in advance.
