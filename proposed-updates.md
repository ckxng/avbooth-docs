# Proposed Updates

1. Merge Aux 1 and Aux 2.
2. Set channels present in the live show to post mixes.  This will ease the burden on the operator in keeping a good mix on Aux.
3. Pull unneeded inputs from the Fx1 send to prevent accidental reverb on non-choral parts.
4. Add the ceiling mics to a DCA to simplify strip assignment

## Inputs and Mixing

The proposed routing improves the operation of the board by leveraging post mixes on the aux and compibing web and lobby mixes.  Since we are all-vocal, we generally want the same mix in the lobby as we have on the stream.  The web/lobby mix can run _mostly_ at 0dB reletive to the main mix, except for the lead, which we would pull down to bring him closer to the average volume of the four choral parts.  Minor tweak in-service would then trickle down to the web/lobby mix automatically.  It's not perfect, and the operator would still have control of the web/lobby mix via. aux 1 faders, but it should make the job slightly easier.

## Strip Assignment

This layout reduces the number of strips to just what is needed for regular board operation.  Some minimization is also gained by assigning a DCA to the ceilings mics, which would almost always be moved together anyway.

The first three groups of strips are channels which are present in both the main and web mix.  The fourth group of strips then is set aside as a convenaince to the operator so that he does not have to switch to the web mix in order to make the most common in-service adjustments for that mix (adjustment or muting of the ceiling mics, or overall web level).

## Possible Future Enhancement

A set of stage monitors or in-ear monitoring system would be a beneficial improvement, but it is not funded for this year.  Since the praise team does not stand on stage, the monitor is of limited utility for service.  Given our current tendencies, it's main use would be during special events like VBS.
