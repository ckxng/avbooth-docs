# Sunday Morning Presentations

Our Sunday morning presentations are put together by voluneers.  To accomodate busy schedules, we are asking for everyone's participation in 

Here is the timeline for a typical Sunday:

**Due by Wednesday 5pm** - Mike updates the date on the Order of Worship page and adjusts Bible verses

**Due by Wednesday 5pm** - Tom updates the date on the Order of Worship page (if he got to it before Mike) and adjusts the songs
- Let us know in advance if a song is suspected to not be in the system
- If a song needs to be added, [send us an email](sending-lyrics.md) at this time

**Due by Wednesday 5pm** - Special announcement slides, videos, or other one-off elements of the service
- Here are some instructions for [sending these to us by email](sending-announcements.md).

**Due by Friday 5pm** - Media Team creates the presentation based on the Order of Worship in the app
- We will skim the app for upcoming events and announcements and _may_ create slides for some of them, even if we have not recieved an email about it.
- If any pieces of the Order of Worship are not present in the app by Wednesday at 5pm, they are not guaranteed to make it into the Sunday morning presentation.
- Once the presentaion is complete, the Media Team will clone the presentation with _next_ week's date as well.  So that "next week's" presentation is already ready in case someone wants to work in advance.

**Self-serve - at any time** - Randy adds his slides into the presentation

- Since the Media Team duplicates presentations one week in advance, Randy can go in at _any time_ during the week and add his slides.

Most people on this list have virtually unlimited time to prepare, and at least a two day window to deliver their task.  The exception to that is the Media team.  We cannot begin our work until all of the prerequisite items are turned in.  Communication is key!  If you think you might be late, please text Cameron ASAP.

Thank you so much for partnering with us to make every worship amazing!
