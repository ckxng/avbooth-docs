# Sunday Morning Presentations

Our Sunday morning presentations are put together by voluneers.  To accomodate busy schedules, we are asking for everyone's participation in 

Here is the timeline for a typical Sunday:

**Due by Tuesday 5pm** - Mike resets the Order of Worship page in the app to include bible verses

**Due by Wednesday 5pm** - Tom adds the songs to the Order of Worship in the app
- Let us know in advance if a song is suspected to not be in the system
- If a song needs to be added, [send us an email](sending-lyrics.md) at this time

Due by Wednesday 5pm** - Special announcement slides, videos, or other one-off elements of the service
- Here are some instructions for [sending these to us by email](sending-announcements.md).

**Due by Friday 5pm** - Media Team creates the presentation based on the Order of Worship in the app
- We will skim the app for upcoming events and announcements and _may_ create slides for some of them, even if we have not recieved an email about it.
- If any pieces of the Order of Worship are not present in the app at this time, they are not guaranteed to make it into the Sunday morning presentation.

**Final task** - Randy adds his slides into the presentation

Most people on this list have virtually unlimited time to prepare, and at least a two day window to deliver their task.  The exception to that is the Media team.  We cannot begin our work until all of the prerequisite items are turned in.  Communication is key!  If you think you might be late, please text Cameron ASAP.

Thank you so much for partnering with us to make every worship amazing!
