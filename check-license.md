# Verifying Streaming Licenses

In order to LiveStream a song on Facebook and YouTube, we need to verify that the song is covered by our CCLI Streaming Plus license.  Here is how you check a song to see if it's ok.

1. Open [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/browse)
2. Find the specific song you wish to stream.  It must be an exact match for title, artist, and album.  If your goal is to stream in Spotify, checking to make sure the album art matches can be a great time-saver.
3. Open the album page which contains that song.  [example: Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)](https://music.apple.com/us/album/amazing-grace-my-chains-are-gone/1440842149?i=1440842278)
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and look at the copyright line.  example: This Compilation &#8471; 2011 sixsteprecords/Sparrow Records.
5. Open the [CCLI Copyright Owner's Lists](https://us.ccli.com/copyright-owners-lists/)
6. Select "Streaming Plus License - Covered Record Labels" from the dropdown box.
7. Search for the copyright owner in the search box.  example: sixsteprecords/Sparrow Records.
8. If the copyright owner is listed, we can stream the recorded version of this song.
