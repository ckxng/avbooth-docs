# Presentation Checklist

## Prepare for Worship Service (8:30)
- Ensure the sound board and equipment rack is already on.
  - the Atlona HDMI distribution boxes should have blue lights on them
- Turn on and login to the computer ( Operator / jesusiskingyeah ) (power button on back of screen)
- Allow the computer to completely finish booting up
- While you wait, turn on all 3 projectors.
  - Epson is the projector right above the sound board
  - Panasonic are the two projectors up front.
- Move the mouse and make sure you can see it on the projectors
  - The OS X application doc (all the icons) should be on the desk monitor
  - The projector should be black and blank
  - Moving the mouse off the right side of the screen should move the mouse to the projector, where you should see it moving
- Open Proclaim from the application bar the bottom of the screen
  - You should already be logged in as media@wwcoc.org.
- Go to File > Open, and locate this week’s presentation and import it.
  - The presentation may be named similar to: "Sunday YYYYMMDD" for example "Sunday 20220529"
- Verify that all media and songs are present, with no yellow exclamation points or “file does not exist” messages on any of the media.
  - Compare the slideshow with the order of worship that was emailed out
- If there is time remaining, open iTunes and start one of the music playlists.

## Soundcheck (9:00)
- Start the presentation and standby for sound check (9:00)
- Stop the music playlist in iTunes (if running)
- Make any corrections identified during soundcheck.
- After soundcheck, start the music playlist again.

If there is a problem with the slides that you cannot fix yourself, contact Cameron, Mayra, or Megan.  Additional training can also be provided that will teach you how to create and fix ProPresenter playlists.

## During Worship Service
- During the countdown timer (immediately before worship starts), stop the music playlist and close iTunes.
- Pay attention and listen for cues.
- Look ahead at upcoming slides to anticipate what will be needed next
  - Sometimes slides are out-of-order, especially announcements
  - It’s our job to get the right slide on screen!
- Be proactive during prayers and communication when non-staff are on stage
  - They may not have the verse memorized, etc.
  - There’s no harm in a slide going up slightly early, if unsure.

After Worship Service
Shutdown ProPresenter, the computer, the TVs, and all 3 projectors.
Clean up your workspace.
