# Sending the Media Team Lyrics

If we don't have your song in our database already, this is the best way to send us the lyrics.

Please email a copy of the lyrics to media@wwcoc.org.  They can be contained in a doc or just pasted into the email itself, as long as we can read the lyrics.  Please make sure it's a format we can copy and paste (not a photo of text).

## Best Format

This is the best way to send us lyrics.  Our software understands this format natively, and makes it very easy for the operater to skip around the song or to skip verses.

_When verses are in this format, we can save multiple arrangement presets and the operator can jump to the third verse just by pressing "3" on the keyboard.  We thank you in advance!_

    Arrangement: V1, R, V2, R, V3, R

    VERSE 1
    Blue skies and rainbows and sunbeams from heaven
    Are what I can see when my Lord is living in me

    VERSE 2
    Green grass and flowers all blooming in springtime
    Are works of the Master I live for each day

    VERSE 3
    Tall mountains green valleys the beauty that
    Surrounds me all make me aware of
    The One who made it all

    REFRAIN
    I know that Jesus is well and alive today
    He makes His home in my heart
    Never more will I be all alone since
    He promised me that we never would part

The software understands the following sections:
- Verse: V, V1, 1
- Chorus: C, C1
- Pre-chorus: P, P1
- Bridge: B, B1
- Tag: T, T1
- Interlude: I, I1

## Alternate Format

If a song does not have an easily defined structure, you can forgo the section labels and give us the song in this simplified format instead.

    Blue skies and rainbows and sunbeams from heaven
    Are what I can see when my Lord is living in me

    I know that Jesus is well and alive today
    He makes His home in my heart
    Never more will I be all alone since
    He promised me that we never would part

    Green grass and flowers all blooming in springtime
    Are works of the Master I live for each day

    I know that Jesus is well and alive today
    He makes His home in my heart
    Never more will I be all alone since
    He promised me that we never would part

    Tall mountains green valleys the beauty that
    Surrounds me all make me aware of
    The One who made it all

    I know that Jesus is well and alive today
    He makes His home in my heart
    Never more will I be all alone since
    He promised me that we never would part
