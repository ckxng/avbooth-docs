But these instructions are specific to Woodland West.

Once a song has been used in Proclaim, it’s very easy to re-use, and it will remember any customizations that were made to the Slide Group.

1. Click on the slide just before where you want the song inserted.  (I prefer to use a blank slide for this purpose and just keep moving it around to where I want the next song to go.)
2. Open the Add Item menu
3. Select Re-use Item
4. Search for the song name or number.
5. You will see one or more Slide Group entries with names like “WW 0123 - Song Name”.  Each entry will have a date listed when it was used.
6. If you know this is a Slide Group that we will be coming back to frequently, click the star icon to make it as a favorite.
7. Select the Slide Group you want to import.
8. Click “Add selected”.

Check to make sure that you haven’t accidentally added the new slide group inside another slide group.  I do that sometimes if I’m not careful… if so, just drag the whole slide group out to where it belongs.

Sometimes, you may want to do things differently this week than we normally do.  That’s great!  If you have a small change to make, feel free to do that right here in the Slide Group.  You can copy, delete, or insert slides as needed.  If you make tweaks to the Slide Group, be sure to give this week’s slide group a distinctive name using the format “WW 0123 - Song Name (what we did differently)” to make it easier to tell apart when looking for Slide Groups to re-use in future weeks.

If you have large changes to make, or if you want to add additional verses that were previously removed (for example: we normally single 1,2,3 verse, but today we want all verses), it might simply be easier to follow the “Add a song from the songbook that we have not used in Proclaim before” instructions instead.

But these instructions are specific to Woodland West.

All of the songbook images have been added to Proclaim as collections using names such as “0123 - Song Name-SFP”.  These can be added to a worship service as a Slide Group and customized according to our preferences.  The resulting Slide Group can be re-used in later weeks.

1. Click on the slide just before where you want the song inserted.  (I prefer to use a blank slide for this purpose and just keep moving it around to where I want the next song to go.)
2. Open the Media menu item.
3. Select the Browse Media entry.
4. Search for the song name or number.
5. You will see an image collection come up with the format “0123 - Song Name-SFP”.
6. Click on the title of the collection.
7. Click on the first slide in the collection.
8. Click the “Add Series (# items)” button on the right side.  (Double clicking on a slide or clicking the Add Image button will insert slide one at a time.  The Add Series button inserts all of the slides for this song in the correct order all at once.)
9. In the presentation order, select the first slide in this song.
10. Hold shift, and click on the last slide in this song.  Now all of the slides for this song are selected.
11. Right click (or option-click on a Mac) on the selected slides, and click Group.
12. Name the group using this pattern: “WW 0123 - Song Name”  (If we customize the song, consider indicating that in the name as follows: “WW 0123 - Song Name (1,2,4, extra chorus)”.  This will make it easier to identify in future weeks.)

The WW in the song name is an easy way to tell our custom Slide Groups apart from everything else when searching in the media browser.  Using a consistent naming convention is strongly recommended to make our lives easier in the future.

## Removing an image collection for a song from the library.

But these instructions are specific to Woodland West.

If we accidentally mess up an image collection for a song, such as by accidentally deleting one or more images from the collection, the easiest way to fix it is to just re-import it.  Use these instructions to delete the image collection, then import it fresh using the next set of instructions.

1. Open the Media menu item.
2. Select the Browse Media entry.
3. Search for the song name or number.
4. You will see an image collection come up with the format “0123 - Song Name-SFP”.
5. Click on the title of the collection.
6. Look at the slides for this song.  They will be named like “1 - 0123 Song Name-SFP”.  Determine if the images are really messed up.  Are images altered?  Missing?
7. If you still want to delete the image collection, continue.
8. Delete each image in the collection one at a time, by selecting it and pressing the Delete button.  (If you are just here to fix some duplicated images, feel free to just delete those.  You don’t have to delete them all unless that’s what you really need.)
9. Close the media browser when you are done.

If you need to import a fresh copy of a song, move on to the next set of instructions.

## Importing a song from the SFP library as an image collection.

More help topics can be found on the help website here:
[Proclaim Help](https://support.faithlife.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000510451-Faithlife-Proclaim)

But these instructions are specific to Woodland West.

These instructions will allow you to import a song from the Songs of Faith and Praise PowerPoint library (or another similar PowerPoint-based song) as an image collection.

Before importing a song, please make sure that no image collection currently exists for this song in the media library.  If you import a song a second time, it will add additional slides behind whatever is there, doubling the slides.

1. Locate the PowerPoint slide deck.  Most songs are located in Google Drive> AV> All Songs.
2. Ensure the file name is set correctly.  It should match the format “0123 - Song Name”. The filename will become the name of the image collection.  (Sometimes there is extra text after the song name, indicating that the song is in a different key, or has an extra verse.  That’s ok.  Some medley songs might be in the format “0123-0124 - Song Name and Song Name” or similar.  That’s also ok.)
3. If the song you are uploading is not from the songbook, make sure it has “0000 - “ at the front of the song name, so we can still identify it as a song when we are searching.
4. If you are using Google Drive in the web browser, download the PowerPoint deck to your computer.  If Google Drive is already syncing to your computer, then you can just use the file where it is.
5. In Proclaim, open the Media menu item.
6. Select Import Media, and Song Lyrics.
7. On the right, select “Import as images”.
8. Find the PowerPoint deck that you want to import in the file browser, and select it.  (You can select more than one.)
9. Click Open.
10. Proclaim will convert the PowerPoint slide decks into sequences of images.  It will show you what it found, and if there were any errors.
11. If everything looks ok, click the “Add ## songs” button.  (Where ## is the number of songs processed successfully)
12. A message will come up saying that Proclaim is now uploading media.  Click Done.
13. In the top right, you will see Proclaim synchronizing (spinning blue circle).  It is now uploading all of the images to the cloud, so that we can use them in future weeks.

## What songs have already been uploaded?

This describes what songs have already been uploaded from the Google Drive> AV> All Songs folder.

The following song collections have already been imported:

- In The Books - SFP with song numbers
- Not In The Books - numbers like 0000

The following collections have not yet been imported in their entirety:

- Additional Songs - are in TIF format and cannot be bulk-uploaded
- Anthem Songs - has duplicates from other collections
- Spanish - don’t want to make things confusing unless we really need them
- New Slides - some of these files are not songs

Feel free to upload any songs that we need!  Open the file, make sure it looks good, then follow the instructions above to import it.

Don’t forget to name the file “0000 - Song Name” if it doesn’t come from our song book.  The “0000” will help us identify it as a song when we are searching through media.
