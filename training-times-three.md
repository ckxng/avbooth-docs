# Super Duper Thank You!

We love that you're donating your time to the media ministry!  And we would like to say thank you to our volunteers who do the following:

1. Train and demonstrate competency up to Level 1 in all three areas
2. Agree to join the rotation as either a regularly scheduled volunteer or a backup volunteer
3. Agree to join the list of people who we reach out to for special events, like weddings and funerals

For these volunteers, you will recieve a SPILL PROOF tumbler, engraved with your name.  Because you're awesome!
